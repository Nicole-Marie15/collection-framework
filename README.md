This program is a simple Java application designed to show key concepts of the Java Collections Framework.

The main purpose of this program is to illustrate how to manipulate a list of numeric values (more specifically Double values) using the Java Collections Framework. The project demonstrates how to create, populate, sort, search, and modify an ArrayList of Double values, as well as how to use an Iterator to traverse and print the list.

Important programming concepts and tools:
ArrayList: An array used to store Double values.
Collections Class: Provides a methods for performing common operations on collections. This includes sorting and searching.
Iterators: Used to traverse and print each element in the ArrayList.
Collections.sort: Sorts the elements of the ArrayList in ascending order.
Collections.binarySearch: Searches for a specific value in the sorted list and returns its index.
Collections.fill: Replaces all elements in the ArrayList with a specific value.

The expected inputs of this program is to work with a predefined arraylist that contains four double values.
The expected output of this program is to output the original arraylist including the double values that was added while displaying the values in the order it was inserted.
After the list was sorted in ascending order, the program outputs the newly ordered arraylist showing all elements from smallest to largest. 
The program then performs a binary search for the value 1.5 in the sorted list. It will then output the index where 1.5 is located in the arraylist. 
After all the elements in the arraylist has been replaced with 0.0, the program will output the modified list. This list should include 0.0 values.
